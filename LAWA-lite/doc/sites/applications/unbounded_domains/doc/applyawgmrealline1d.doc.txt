The APPLY-AWGM on the real line
-------------------------------

Source file `applications/unbounded_domains/adwav/ghs-adwav-realline-helmholtz1d.cpp`

This program implements the $\textbf{APPLY}$-AWGM on the real line from Section 3.5.2 using different types of wavelets (biorthogonal, $L_2$-orthonormal, special multiwavelets from Chapter 5). It can in particular be used to realize the numerical experiments presented in Section 4.4.3.

Note that this program is only for the following one-dimensional problem: Find $u \in H^1(\mathbb{R})$ such that


___ LATEX ________________
   -\Delta u + c \cdot u = f, \qquad f \in H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}).
___________________________

As another important remark, we point out that the constant `JMINOFFSET` in lawa/methods/adaptive/datastructures/index.h needs to be set in a way that $\text{JMINOFFSET}+j_0 \geq 0$ in order to ensure proper functionality of underlying hash maps. When you change JMINOFFSET, you need to re-compile the library liblawa!!

Moreover, we point out that this program relies on the availability of a rhs-file for the implementation of the routine $\textbf{RHS}$ from Section 4.4.2. The correct set up of this file can be inferred from the example files within this package. Furthermore, we remark that such files can also be generated by the __simplified AWGM__. We provide some examples of such files.
