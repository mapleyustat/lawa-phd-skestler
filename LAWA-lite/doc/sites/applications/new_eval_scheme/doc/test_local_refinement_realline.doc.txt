Test of local refinement and neighbor functions on the realline
---------------------------------------------------------------

Source file `applications/new_eval_scheme/test_local_refinement_realline.cpp`

Local refinement and neighbors for realline bases are just the same as for __refinement and neighbors for interval bases__. The only difference is that we do not have a bound for translation indices. In order to allow for a simpler implementation,  the realline case is treated separately.
