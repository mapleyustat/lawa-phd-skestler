The simplified AWGM on the real line in two dimensions
------------------------------------------------------

Source file `applications/unbounded_domains/s-adwav/s-adwav-realline-helmholtz2d.cpp`

This program implements the simplified AWGM on the real line from Section 4.6.4 using different types of wavelets ($L_2$-orthonormal, special multiwavelets from Chapter 5). It can in particular be used to realize the numerical experiments from the same section.

Note that this program is only for the following two-dimensional problem: Find $u \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ such that

   -\Delta u + c \cdot u = f, \qquad f \in H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^2).

As another important remark, we point out that the constant `JMINOFFSET` in lawa/methods/adaptive/datastructures/index.h needs to be set in a way that $\text{JMINOFFSET}+j_0^{i} \geq 0$ for $i \in \{1,2\}$ in order to ensure proper functionality of underlying hash maps. When you change JMINOFFSET, you need to re-compile the library liblawa!!
