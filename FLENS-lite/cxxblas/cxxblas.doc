==title:CXXBLAS{cxxblas}==

==ul:begin==
-> Depending on the complexity of the operation the BLAS functions are
   subdivided into three levels.
==ul:end==

==section:Level 1==
Defines vector-vector operations, e.g. vector copying, vector addition,
dot products, ...
==toc:level1/==

==section:Level 2==
Defines matrix-vector operations, e.g. matrix-vector products.
==toc:level2/==

==section:Level 3==
Defines matrix-matrix operations, e.g. matrix-matrix products.
==toc:level3/==

==section:Level 1 Extensions==
Defines some level 1 functions for matrices.  Implementations of these
functions fall back on standard level 1 BLAS.
