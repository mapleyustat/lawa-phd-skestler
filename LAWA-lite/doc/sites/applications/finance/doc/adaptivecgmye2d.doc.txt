Adaptive discretization of the two-dimensional CGMY problem
-----------------------------------------------------------

Source file `applications/finance/cgmye2d_multitree_mw_awgm.cpp`

For the domain $\mathbb{R}^2$, we consider the discretization of the two-dimensional CGMYe problem by $L_2$-orthonormal multiwavelets as described in Section 8.7.3. Note that this program only works for $L_2$-orthonormal wavelets.

Moreover, we only comment on the significant changes of this program compared to the __sparse grid case__.
