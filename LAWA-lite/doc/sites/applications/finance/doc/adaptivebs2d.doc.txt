Adaptive discretization of the two-dimensional Black-Scholes problem
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Source file `applications/finance/bs2d_multitree_mw_awgm.cpp`

For the domain $[-R,R]^2$, we consider the adaptive discretization of the two-dimensional Black-Scholes problem Eq. (8.124) by $L_2$-orthonormal multiwavelets. As described in Section 8.6.3, the usage of this basis has certain advantages compared to biorthogonal wavelets. This is why this program only works for this construction.

Moreover, we make specific use of the multitree algorithms described in Chapters 6 and 7.
