Tutorial 2: Wavelet integrals
=============================

:document:  tutorials::examples::waveletintegrals

We are now coming to integrals involving wavelets. Here, we consider the following types:

___ LATEX ________________
\begin{align*}
 & \int_{\Omega} \psi_{j_1,k_1}(x) \psi_{j_2,k_2}(x) dx \\
 & \int_{\Omega} \psi_{j_1,k_1}(x) f(x) dx \\
 & \int_{\Omega} a(x) \psi_{j_1,k_1}(x) \psi_{j_2,k_2}(x) dx
\end{align*}

Concluding remarks
------------------

For the sake of simplicity, we only consider wavelets here. However, the principle is the same for scaling function where we need to replace `XWavelet` by `XBSpline`.

Observe that integration w.r.t. scaling functions and wavelets is a composed Gauss-Legendre quadrature where we only integrate from singular point to singular point. For this reason, the integration of $\int_{\Omega} \psi_{j_1,k_1}(x) \psi_{j_2,k_2}(x) dx$ can be obtained exactly. Required quadrature orders are selected automatically in dependence of the polynomial order of the wavelet / scaling function.
