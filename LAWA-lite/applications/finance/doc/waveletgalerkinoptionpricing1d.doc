Wavelet Galerkin option pricing in the 1d CGMY model
----------------------------------------------------

Source file `applications/finance/waveletgalerkinoptionpricer1d.cpp`

We describe the program that was used to obtain the results for wavelet Galerkin option pricing in univariate CGMY models (see Section 8.5). In particular, we compare the barrier option approach with the excess-to-payoff formulation.

For the setup of the algebraic system, we refer to the Section 8.5.2. There, in particular, the employed wavelet compression scheme is described.
