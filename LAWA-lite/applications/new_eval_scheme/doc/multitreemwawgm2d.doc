Multiwavelet based implementation of the multitree based AWGM in two dimensions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source file `applications/new_eval_scheme/multitree_mw_awgm2d.cpp`

This program implements the two-dimensional multitree AWGM described in Section 6.5 and, in particular for this program, in Section 7.3 where we consider Poisson's problem on the square $\square = (0,1)^2$ with 

___ LATEX ________________
   -\Delta u = f \text{ on } \square, \qquad u|_{\partial \square} = 0
___________________________

where we choose $f$ to be a constant function. Observe that this choice leads to a singular solution requiring an adaptive scheme in order to obtain the best possible rate (see Section 7.3).
