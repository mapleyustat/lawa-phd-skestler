Computing stiffness matrix entries in the CGMY model
----------------------------------------------------

Source file `finance/finance/test_cgmy_matrixentry.cpp`

For the interval $[0,1]$, we consider biorthogonal as well as $L_2$-orthonormal multiwavelet bases for the discretization of the operator associated to the CGMY model.

Here, we use and compare
- a quadrature based approach (Section B.2),
- a direct evaluation approach (Section B.1 and B.3).

For details, we refer to the corresponding sections in the thesis. Observe that the quadrature based approach applied to the formulation given in Equation (B.4).

The following routines are only implemented for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and, in case of biorthogonal wavelets, $\tilde{d} \in \{2,3\}$.
