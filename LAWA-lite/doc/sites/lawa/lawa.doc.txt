:document:  lawa::documentation

LAWA mainly consists of two parts: _basis constructions_ and _adaptive wavelet algorithms_.
This first release of LAWA covers large parts of the first, but at the moment does not really
provide very much of the second topic.

The documentation will mainly be given in tutorial form to provide a simple entry point. At
the moment a simple uniform example for 1D and 2D is provided to demonstrate the usage of
B-splines, wavelets and bases as well as integral calculations. This documentation will 
steadily grow and bit by bit we will add adaptive stuff soon.
