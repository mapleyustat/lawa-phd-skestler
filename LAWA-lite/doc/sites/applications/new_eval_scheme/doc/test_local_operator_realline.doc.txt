Tree based evaluation of a local operator on the realline
---------------------------------------------------------

Source file `applications/new_eval_scheme/test_local_operator_mw_realline1d.cpp`

We perform the same test as we did for __local operators on the interval__ with the slight difference that we now consider $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ instead of $\Omega = (0,1)$.
More precisely, the bilinear forms we are using now are

___ LATEX ________________
   a(v,w) := \int_{\mathbb{R}}  v'(x) w'(x) dx, \qquad a(w,v) := \int_{\mathbb{R}} v(x) w(x)  dx.
___________________________

The most important difference we need to take into account is that we do not have a bound for translation indices. Therefore, we shall take an arbitrarily but fixed chosen bound for these indices.
