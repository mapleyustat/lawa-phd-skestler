Tree based evaluation of a local operator in two dimensions on the realline
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source file `applications/new_eval_scheme/test_local_operator_mw_realline2d.cpp`

This program is very similar to the corresponding __interval case__. However, for the realline case we focus
- on the usage of $L_2(\mathbb{R})$-orthonormal multiwavelets, and
- on the correct implementation of the underlying algorithms passing performance tests.

Observe that the usage of $L_2(\mathbb{R})$-orthonormal multiwavelets allows for simplifications concerning the wavelet representation of certain operators as described in Section 7.3.
