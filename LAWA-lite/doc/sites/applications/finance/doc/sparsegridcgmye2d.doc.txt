Sparse grid discretization of the two-dimensional CGMY problem
--------------------------------------------------------------

Source file `applications/finance/cgmye2d_multitree_mw_sg.cpp`

For the domain $[-R_1,R_1] \times [-R_2,R_2]$, we consider the discretization of the two-dimensional CGMYe problem by $L_2$-orthonormal multiwavelets (see Section 8.7). As described there, the usage of this basis has certain advantages compared to biorthogonal wavelets. This is why this program only works for this construction.
