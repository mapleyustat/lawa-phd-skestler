Computation of univariate Riesz constants
-----------------------------------------

Source file `applications/unbounded_domains/parameters/eigenvalues.cpp`

This program can be used for the approximate computation of univariate Riesz constants for wavelet bases on unbounded domains ($\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}_+$). Examples of such constants can be found in Sections 4.4.3 and 4.6.1, Sections 5.4 and 5.5.

In particular, we need to take into account the fact that wavelet bases on the real line do not necessarily have a minimal level. Apart from that, the computation of Riesz constants is realized by computing the smallest and the largest eigenvalue of mass or (generalized) stiffness matrices.
