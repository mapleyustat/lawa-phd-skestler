On the adaptive tensor product wavelet Galerkin method with applications in finance
===================================================================================




Here you find the (documented) source code for the numerical results obtained in the PhD thesis "On the adaptive wavelet Galerkin method with applications in finance" by Sebastian Kestler. 

In particular, following the contents of the thesis, we have the following topics

- __Adaptive wavelet methods on unbounded domains__ (Chapter 4)
- __A special multiwavelet basis for unbounded product domains__ (Chapter 5)
- __Fast evaluation of system matrices on multitree structured index sets__ (Chapter 6)
- __Efficient residual computation in the adaptive tensor product wavelet Galerkin method__ (Chapter 7)
- __Wavelet Galerkin methods for the numerical solution of PIDEs in finance__ (Chapter 8)

For implementational reasons, we shall collect programs for Chapters 4 and 5 as well as for Chapters 6 and 7 in one folder each. Here, not only programs are provided, but also test cases in order to allow for

- testing and
- extending

of existing routines and algorithms.

Please note that the documentation of the software related to this PhD thesis does not contain a documentation of the basic routines of LAWA. At this point, we refer to the __documentation__.
