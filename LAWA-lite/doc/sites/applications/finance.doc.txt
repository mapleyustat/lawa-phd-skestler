Wavelet Galerkin methods in numerical finance (Chapter 8)
=========================================================

We describe the realization of the wavelet Galerkin schemes from Chapter 8. The most important ingredient here is the numerical computation of integrals of type

   I_{\lambda,\mu} := \int_{\mathbb{R}} \Big[ \big( \psi_\lambda(x+y) - \psi_\lambda(x) - y \partial\psi_\lambda(x)   \big) k(y) dy  \Big] \psi_{\mu}(x) dx

for a L\'evy kernel $k$ that is in our case given by

   k(x) := C \cdot \Big( \frac{e^{-M|x|}}{|x|^{1+Y}} \mathbf{1}_{\{x>0\}} + \frac{e^{-G|x|}}{|x|^{1+Y}} \mathbf{1}_{\{x<0\}} \Big)

from the well-known CGMY model by Carr, Geman, Madan and Yor. In the sequel, we exclude the case where $Y=0$ and $Y=1$.

The corresponding formulas are described in Appendix B of the PhD thesis. In the following example, these formulas are implemented and tested.

- __Computing stiffness matrix entries in the CGMY model__: `applications/finance/test_cgmy_matrixentry.cpp`

The discretization of the CGMY operator can then used directly to price European options via a Galerkin approach. This is described in Details in Section 8.5. The implementation is given here:

- __Wavelet Galerkin option pricing in the 1d CGMY model__: `applications/finance/waveletgalerkinoptionpricer1d.cpp`
